In today's fast-paced digital landscape, where software development cycles are becoming increasingly shorter and customer expectations continue to soar, the importance of efficient and effective Quality Assurance (QA) processes cannot be overstated.

Nevertheless, as automation increasingly becomes integral to ensuring software quality, it prompts the question: 𝑯𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒘𝒆 𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒅 𝒂 𝒔𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒕 𝒊𝒏 𝒂𝒖𝒕𝒐𝒎𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒖𝒏𝒊𝒕, 𝒔𝒚𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒎, 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒓𝒆𝒈𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒄𝒚𝒄𝒍𝒆𝒔?

The accompanying application prototype aims to delve into the potential for additional automation in the software QA defect triage process. It shows how harnessing the power of ChatGPT LLM can bring about a revolutionary shift in fault detection, assessment, and debugging stages, ultimately transforming our approach to software QA.

The prototype emphasizes the significance of optimizing model hyperparameters, implementing effective and best prompt engineering practices (such as avoiding prompt injection and model hallucination), and generating comprehensive reports.
